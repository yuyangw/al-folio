I am an AI/ML resident at [Apple Machine Learning Research (MLR)](https://machinelearning.apple.com/). Currenly I am working on building generalizable generative models that are domain agnostic and scalable to different applications (e.g. images, 3D, graphs, manifolds, etc). Also, I am interested in how such generative models can help solve broad scientific problems (e.g. drug discovery & protein design). 

Previously I obtain Ph.D. from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) working at the intersection of machine learning, molecular modeling, and chemical physics/biophysics. Especially, I developed self-supervised learning methods to learn molecular representations that generalize on large chemical space. 

Feel free to reach out if intested in my work!
