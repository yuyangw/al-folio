I am an AI Researcher at [Apple Machine Learning Research (MLR)](https://machinelearning.apple.com/). Currently I am working on building generalizable diffusion models that are domain agnostic and scalable to different modalities (e.g. images, 3D, graphs, manifolds, etc). Also, I am interested in how generative models can help solve broad scientific problems (e.g. drug discovery & protein design). Previously I obtain Ph.D. from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) working at the intersection of machine learning, molecular modeling, and chemical physics/biophysics.
