I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> working on Molecular Machine Learning. Previously, I obtained M.S. in Machine Learning from CMU School of Computer Science. You can download my <a href="/assets/pdf/Yuyang_Wang_CV.pdf">CV</a> (last updated April 2023).

<b>Research Interest: </b>
- Machine Learning
- Self-supervised Learning
- Molecular Modeling
- Drug Discovery
- Chemical Physics/Biophysics

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, molecular modeling, and chemical physics/biophysics. I am especially interested in developing self-supervised molecular machine learning methods to learn generic representations that generalize on chemical space. I believe data-driven techniques bear promise for efficient <i>in silico</i> compound design and discovery.
