I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, abvised by Prof. <a href="https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/barati-farimani-amir.html">Amir Barati Farimani</a>. Meanwhile, I am also pursuing a M.S. in Machine Learning at <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/">CMU School of Computer Science</a>. Previously, I obtained my B.Eng. from <a href="https://en.tongji.edu.cn/index.htm">Tongji University</a>.

<b>Research Interest: </b>
- Machine Learning
- Drug Discovery
- Molecular Dynamics
- Nanotechnology

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, molecular dynamics, and drug discovery. I am interested in developing machine learning methods to better understand and explore the molecular dynamics. I am also developing self-supervised molecular machine learning methods to learn generic representations that generalize on various down-stream applications. These data-driven techniques are implemented to estimate unknown bio-interactions between compounds and biological targets (e.g., proteins) for efficient <i>in silico</i> drug design and discovery.
