I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I am abvised by Prof. <a href="https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/barati-farimani-amir.html">Amir Barati Farimani</a> and worked on Molecular Machine Learning. Meanwhile, I am also pursuing a M.S. in Machine Learning at <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/">CMU School of Computer Science</a>.

<b>Research Interest: </b>
- Machine Learning
- Drug Discovery
- Molecular Dynamics
- Nanotechnology

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, drug discovery, and molecular dynamics. I am especially interested in developing self-supervised molecular machine learning methods to learn generic representations that generalize on chemical space. I believe data-driven techniques bear promise for efficient <i>in silico</i> drug design and discovery.
