<b><i>I am actively looking for full time jobs starting Summer 2023!</i></b>

I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I am advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/barati-farimani-amir.html">Amir Barati Farimani</a> and working on Molecular Machine Learning. Meanwhile, I am also pursuing a M.S. in Machine Learning at CMU School of Computer Science. You can download my <a href="/assets/pdf/Yuyang_Wang_CV.pdf">CV</a> (last updated October 2022).

<b>Research Interest: </b>
- Machine Learning
- Self-supervised Learning
- Molecular Modeling
- Drug Discovery
- Computational Material

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, molecular modeling, and computational chemistry/material. I am especially interested in developing self-supervised molecular machine learning methods to learn generic representations that generalize on chemical space. I believe data-driven techniques bear promise for efficient <i>in silico</i> compound design and discovery.
